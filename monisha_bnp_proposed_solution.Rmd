## Problem

BNP Paribas Cardif is a global personal insurance provider. They want to automate the process of determining whether a claim can automatically be accepted or needs to be checked further. The problem is then to take the features available to BNP Paribas Cardif and output the probability that a claim can be accepted. 


## Data

This problem comes with a training data set and a test data set (https://www.kaggle.com/c/bnp-paribas-cardif-claims-management/data). The training data set contains 133 variables, 21 of which are categorical variables and 112 of which are numerical variables. 2 of the categorical variables include the ID and the target (whether or not the claim is acceptable). 

``` {r train}
load(file="train.RData")
str(train, list.len=10)
```

## Solution Outline
1. Data preprocessing
  a. For categorical variables, if there are more than 100 possible values remove it (i.e. v22 has 900+ possible values)
  b. For each variable, go through and mark each of the outliers (lowest/highest 5%) as NA
  c. For each variable, find the average value and replace all NA's with that average value
2. Feature Engineering (possible methods)
  a. Separate categorical variables into binary variables for each possible value 
  b. Do univariate regression to see which variables have the highest correlation to acceptable claims
3. Model
  a. Linear Regression
4. Cross-validation to tweak model 
  a. k-fold cross validation

## Deliverables
1. Slide deck explaining process
2. Code
